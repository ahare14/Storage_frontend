# Container Pal - Overview:

Container Pal is an application that looks to connect people who need to store items with individuals that have extra storage space at their home.  The application looks to help with decentralizing storage so that users can look to avoid paying high fees for public storage.

As a lister you are able to list the location of your storage space, the square feet of space you have for storage, the room type that user will have access to, the price you are going to charge per sqft, and if they space is temperature controlled.  

As a storer you can keep track of all the various storage spaces you have rented out, and search for a storage space.

The frontend of the application is built using React, while the backend is built using Rails and deployed on Heroku.
